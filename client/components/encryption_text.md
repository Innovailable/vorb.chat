The video, audio and text chat data is transmitted through an end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer connection using WebRTC. Our server is only used to establish the connection and we can not decrypt your information. To learn more about WebRTC security in general have a look at [this article](https://bloggeek.me/is-webrtc-safe/).

To verify the encryption you can compare the keys below with your conversation partner. It is usually enough to compare a few digits from the start or end of the keys. You can speak them out loud or use another secure connection. Your local key should be their remote key and the other way around. Please note that the keys are different for each peer.
