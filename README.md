# UWP

This is a WebRTC based video chat platform. It is using peer to peer
connections and end to end encryption. It supports two to around four
participants in a conversation (based on bandwidth).

A server module for more concurrent participants in a conversation might be
added later.

The project is based on [rtc-lib](https://github.com/Innovailable/rtc-lib). If
you would like to integrate something like this into your project feel free to
contact us at mail@innovailable.eu.
